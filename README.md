311 data for community board members
====================================

"Trends" sends emails to community board members with summaries of trends in 311 complaints, broken down by issue.

Background:

This project helps Community Board Members take advantage of NYC 311 data to help broaden participation among a larger number of Community Board Residents. 

Community Boards in New York City have expressed a common interest in engaging more community residents and in making better use of 311 data. One way to raise the profile of the work that Community Boards do is to inform meeting agenda items with information about issues that matter to a greater number of residents.

“Trends” emails meet this objective by providing concise summaries and clear graphs to relay information quickly. 

“Trends” snapshots will inform Community Board Members of interest items of which they were not previously aware. Community Boards that have relied on anecdotal information will have a broader scope, informed by data, to create more evidence-based agenda items. 

We expect this format to increase community engagement by showing residents that their Community Board is working on issues that matter to them –  evidenced by 311 call trends.

The current issue of "Trends" is for Community Board 9 and focuses on housing complaints, most of which are heating and plumbing - a typiccal trend for this time of year.


The following link documents direct feedback from New York City Community Boards regarding their needs. This, along with the "Trends" team's interviews with staffers from 311 and the New York City Council, informed the "Trends" team's  approach to this project.
